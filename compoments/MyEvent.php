 * Event is the base class for all event classes.
 *
 * It encapsulates the parameters associated with an event.
 * The [[sender]] property describes who raises the event.
 * And the [[handled]] property indicates if the event is handled.
 * If an event handler sets [[handled]] to be true, the rest of the
 * uninvoked handlers will no longer be called to handle the event.
 *
 * Additionally, when attaching an event handler, extra data may be passed
 * and be available via the [[data]] property when the event handler is invoked.
